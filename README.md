# my_pytorch_pratice
This is a repository that I use to save the code for praticing pytorch frame. 

The dataset is constructed from the pictures of dogs and cats which are downloaded from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats.

I still try to improve the correct rate of trained conventional neural network. But it seems always underfitted.
