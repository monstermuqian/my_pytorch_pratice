# my_pytorch_pratice
This is a repository that I use to save the code for praticing pytorch frame. 

The dataset is constructed from the pictures of dogs and cats which are downloaded from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats.

The code of 'seperation_data.py' is used for seperating the training data into training set and validation set, which is grouped together at the first when they was downloaded.

I still try to improve the correct rate of trained conventional neural network. But it seems always underfitted.

all works are done. The correct rate of training set is 99% and of validation set is 98%.
